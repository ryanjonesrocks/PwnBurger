A Burger themed repository dedicated towards exploring all the different types of Core Dumps and Segmentation Faults in C/C++. The aim of this repository is to explore writing better C++ code to avoid common mistakes made by lower level programmers. Many of these segmentation faults can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in exisiting Application Software such as Stack Buffer Overflow, Format String Vulnerabilities, Use After Free, and Return Oriented Programming.
